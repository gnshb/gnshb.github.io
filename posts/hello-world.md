# Hello, World!

*January 2026*

Welcome to my blog! This is where I'll share thoughts on my research journey.

## What to expect

- **Research notes** — papers I read, ideas I explore
- **Technical tutorials** — useful techniques and tools
- **Reflections** — lessons from coursework and research

## A bit of math

Euler's identity:

$$e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$$

Connects five constants: $e$, $i$, $\pi$, $1$, and $0$.
